A rather old-time game in a simple console for windows ;)

This is a code-block IDE project.

The source code is complete inside the main.c file and can be read using any text editor.

The app hasn't been built, but has been locally tested.
To build the application from source, you need a C/C++ IDE (codeblocks preferred for this one), with the complete set of compilers and debuggers(if you are dev)
